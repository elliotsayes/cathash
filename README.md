# cathash
Simple SQLite database lookup API written in python.

Made for the specific usecase of finding a [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) based on a [catalog number](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release/Catalog_Number) or discogs id (e.g. the 10016173 in <https://www.discogs.com/release/10016173>).
